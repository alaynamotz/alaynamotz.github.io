		<p>This fall semester my focus has mainly been on honing my skills as designer. 
		Learning new skills and mastering the old ones. 
		When I entered the design program at Tech a year ago, I knew absolutely nothing about the rules and standards of design. 
		I just created what I wanted and then made it fit the prompt anyway I could.
		The work from last year is some of my proudest work I've created, but I wanted to change my design process.
		I wanted to actually start with the prompt instead of it being an after thought.
		To be more disciplined and start following a more decisive design process.
		However, I learned very quickly that I can adopt some things into my process, but others are going to hurt me more than help me.
		</p>
		
		<p>A traditional design process may include sketching your ideas and creating multiple mock-ups. Then creating process work and planning every single step out.
		I can not and probably never will design like that.
		My sketches always seem to hinder me instead of help me.
		And when I really start working I can't be bothered to worry about process work.
		I like my work to seem effortless but not rushed. That I just let my mind work and my hands follow.
		My inspiration for most of my work comes from music.
		Whatever mood I'm in is reflected through my music which then is carried into my work.
